"""Fused tensor-parallel MoE for SM12x: route -> FC1 -> activation -> FC2 ->
scatter, in one launch family.

Recipes (``META.recipes``) are arguments, not separate ops: nvfp4, mxfp4,
w4a8_mx, w4a8_nvfp4, w4a16 (weight layouts packed/modelopt/nf3_2p1 and the
``exl3_trellis_mcg`` full-rotation source). Activations: silu, situ, relu2,
swigluoai_uninterleave. Kernel
regimes (micro / dynamic / tiny-decode / w4a16) are selected declaratively by
``plan_execution``.

Weight lifecycle (host-side, one-time):
    ``plan_weights`` -> ``prepare_weights`` -> ``ExpertWeights``
Runtime lifecycle:
    ``plan(Caps)`` -> ``bind`` / ``bind_sparse`` / ``bind_route``
    (allocation-free views) -> ``run`` / ``run_sparse`` / ``route``
    (CUDA-graph capture safe)
``required_nbytes(Caps)`` prices that scratch without compiling launches or
retaining storage.
``route_topk`` is a standalone one-shot top-k router; ``run_sparse`` fuses
gate -> top-k -> experts from router logits.

Example:
    from sparkinfer.moe import fused_moe

    wplan   = fused_moe.plan_weights(quant_modes="nvfp4",
                                     source_format="modelopt_nvfp4", ...)
    experts = fused_moe.prepare_weights(plan=wplan, ...)
    plan    = fused_moe.plan(fused_moe.Caps(...))
    spec    = plan.scratch_specs()[0]
    scratch = torch.empty(spec.shape, dtype=spec.dtype, device=spec.device)
    binding = fused_moe.bind(plan, scratch=scratch, a=x, experts=experts,
                             topk_weights=tw, topk_ids=ti)
    out     = fused_moe.run(binding=binding)
